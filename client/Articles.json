    "title": "Kimchi Mamas",
    "content": "This reminds me of the old school blogs (before affiliate marketing and monetizing was so popular.) A group of 6 moms founded this blog and they all contribute their brand of mommy hood, with some delish recipes scattered in between. Kimchi Mamas now have 12 contributing editors. This is a great blog filled with anecdotes and the trials and joys of being a mom raising Korean American kids. Lots of variety and lots of great recipes too! Most of the moms also have their own blogs too. So this blog is filled with cross-posting. Great place for similar moms to network from.",
